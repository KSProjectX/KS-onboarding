\begin{abstract}
This document defines the comprehensive scope of the K-Square Programme Onboarding Agent project, 
outlining prerequisites, system architecture, user interface requirements, agent capabilities, 
and an onboarding process. The project aims to transform manual programme team onboarding into an 
automated, intelligent system that delivers domain-specific insights, client profiles, and actionable 
recommendations. This scope encompasses the evolutionary development phases from the 
current Proof of Concept (PoC) to a fully-featured enterprise solution, including team composition, deliverables, 
and development timeline estimates.
